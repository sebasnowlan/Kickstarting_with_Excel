# Kickstarting_with_Excel

## Overview of Project
To determine what the Theatre fundraising outcomes were vs set goals. 
### Purpose
To analyze the Theatre fundraising outcomes vs set goals based on launch dates and fundraising goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis was performed by examining whether the amount pledged for each play met the goal set.  The first analysis looked at three categories of whether the pledge was successful, failed or cancelled by month and a line graph illustrates the trend by month for each category.  The second analysis looked at the percentage of successful, failed and cancelled pledges by goal level and a graph was used to illustrate the trend.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the line graph, the most successful pledge outcomes occur in May and begin to trend downwards between May to September.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the line graph, the most successul pledges occur when the goal is set at either less than $1,000 or between $35,000 and $39,999.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I personally did not encounter any challenges compiling the data but one challenge is that I can see happening is that when we add the year in a new column, to ensure that all the rows in the table have the formula, all filters in the Kickstarter tab should be cleared and only use the pivot tables to clear the data.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- The two conculsions about the Outcomes based on Launch Date are that the most successful plegdes peak in May and start to trend downward bewteeen May and September.  Failed pledges seem to trend relatively evenly throughout each month, although with some minor fluctuations.  Therfore, the pledges can fail regardless the month and no particular month seems to have any impact on the number of failed pledges.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- Pledge goals over $45,000 have the highest fail rate, suggesting that the goal is unattainable. Any plays created should have revenue expectations below $45,000 if they are to be successfull in meeting revenue requirements.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- Limitations of the dataset include the lack of costing information and there we cannot analyze the profitability of each play.  A play can be very successful of bringing in pledges but without knowing how much it costs, it is difficult to know whether the play will either make money, break even, or even lose money.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- For the both the Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals, a clustered column graph (either bar or column) can be used where it depicts, by month, the successful, failed and cancelled pledges (better than a line graph does).  We can also create a trend graph for successful pledges over the past years to see the trend of whether successful pledges have gone up or down over the years.
